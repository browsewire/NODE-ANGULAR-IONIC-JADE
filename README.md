Sample app code using NODE/ANGULAR/IONIC/JADE

To run it, make sure you have latest version of repo ($ git pull or git clone ...),
install all dependencies ($ npm i && bower i),
run it with gulp ($ gulp).

Other useful gulp tasks:
$ gulp build //creates minified version of app and puts it to "dist" folder (can be useful while building android/ios app)
$ gulp build-and-run //do the same as prev, but also runs it in browser, so you will be able to test how minifies version looks and works
$ gulp clean //removes folders ".tmp" and "dist", can be useful if some weird stuff will appears. Usually after run "gulp serve" after "gulp build".
